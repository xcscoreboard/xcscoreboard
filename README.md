This release is the initial public version of the Cross Country Scoreboard (xcscoreboard) software application that performs real-time Windows based dual-laptop orchestrated bib based scoring and timing of cross country races (can be used with or without a timing system).

Cross Country Scoreboard is built to stream predicted race results to an online mobile friendly web-based scoreboard so that fans and spectators can enjoy the experience of real-time team scoring and placement well before the race has finished. Just set-up your race and activate your scoreboard. Then send fans to [xcscoreboard.com](http://www.xcscoreboard.com). From there, they will find your streaming scoreboard where they can pull up a live-stream of team and individual results for each of your event's races.
